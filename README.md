# 🧑‍💼 Employee Churn Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
Organizations often face challenges in retaining employees, leading to increased hiring and training costs. This project focuses on predicting **employee churn** using historical data and **AutoML modeling with PyCaret**. The goal is to enable HR teams to proactively identify employees at risk of leaving and take preventive measures.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
The organization is experiencing challenges with employee retention and seeks to:  
- Identify employees who are likely to leave.  
- Take proactive measures to reduce churn.  

### Pilot Program Focus:
- Targeted **new employees** for early churn risk prediction.  
- Built an **AutoML model** trained on historical data to predict potential churners.

## 🛠 Project Agenda  

### 1. Build Database (Google BigQuery)  
- Created a centralized database to store historical employee data.  

### 2. Connect Python to BigQuery (Colab)  
- Integrated **Google Colab** with BigQuery for seamless data extraction and analysis.  

### 3. Build Churn Model (PyCaret - AutoML)  
- Leveraged **PyCaret** for rapid experimentation and model selection.  
- Focused on **classification models**, model evaluation, and feature importance.  

### 4. Export Model Output to BigQuery  
- Sent predictions and processed data back to BigQuery for reporting.  

### 5. Build Dashboard (Looker Studio)  
- Developed an **interactive dashboard** to monitor churn risk and employee insights.  

### 6. Recommendations (PowerPoint / Google Slides)  
- Created a management-friendly report summarizing:  
  - High-risk employees  
  - Insights from the model  
  - Suggested HR interventions
